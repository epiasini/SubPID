function I_II=intersection_information_from_binned_response(S,R,C, R_bins, method)

% intersection_information_from_binned_response: Computes intersection information II of a perceptual discrimination
% dataset where the experimenter recorded, in each of n_trial trials, the stimulus S, some neural feature R, and the choice C.
%
% The information-theoretic intersection information II is defined and described in Pica et al (2017), Advances in Neural
% Information Processing, "Quantifying how much sensory information in a neural code is relevant for behavior".


% Inputs:
% S must be a one dimensional array of 1 X n_trials elements representing 
% the discrete value of the stimulus presented in each trial.

% R must be a one dimensional array of 1 X n_trials elements representing 
% the discrete value of the neural feature R recorded in each trial. The 
% recorded response feature can be multidimensional, but its dimensionality 
% should be reduced to construct the vector R. To reliably estimate II from 
% the empirical probability distribution p(s,r,c), the dimension of the 
% neural feature R should be roughly reduced to less than 
% n_trials/(4*n_stimuli*n_choices) values - though we are developing robust 
% non-parametric methods to assess the significance of II for any dimension
% of R. Here, we implemented arguably the simplest dimensionality reduction 
% of R - we discretize R into R_bins bins (R_bins can be set by the user, 
% or is conservatively set to 3 by default) that are equally populated.
%
% C must be a one dimensional array of 1 X n_trials elements representing the discrete value of the
% choice made by the animal in each trial.
