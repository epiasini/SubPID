SubPID - Subatomic Partial Information Decomposition
=========================

This package is composed by two parts:

- A MATLAB implementation of the positive information decomposition
  (PID) for distributions over three random variables using the
  definitions from Bertschinger, N., Rauh, J., Olbrich, E., Jost, J.,
  and Ay, N. /Quantifying unique information./ Entropy,
  16(4):2161â€“2183, 2014.
- A MATLAB numerical implementation of the subatomic partial
  information decomposition proposed in Pica et al., (submitted).
