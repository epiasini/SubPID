SubPID - Subatomic Partial Information Decomposition
=========================

This package is composed by two parts:

- A MATLAB implementation of the partial information decomposition
  (PID) for distributions over three random variables using the
  definitions from Bertschinger, N., Rauh, J., Olbrich, E., Jost, J.,
  and Ay, N. /Quantifying unique information./ Entropy,
  16(4):2161–2183, 2014.
- A MATLAB numerical implementation of the subatomic partial
  information decomposition proposed in Pica et al, /Invariant
  components of synergy, redundancy, and unique information among
  three variables/,
  [arXiv:1706.08921 \[cs.IT\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08921),
  2017.
